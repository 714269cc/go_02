package timer

// Timer is a runtime-managed timer.
//
// Code outside runtime has to be careful in using a timer value.
//
// Code that creates a new timer value can set the When, Period, F,
// Arg, and Seq fields.
// A new timer value may be passed to addtimer (called by time.startTimer).
// After doing that no fields may be touched.
//
// An active timer (one that has been passed to addtimer) may be
// passed to deltimer (time.stopTimer), after which it is no longer an
// active timer.  It is an inactive timer.
// In an inactive timer the period, f, arg, and seq fields may be modified,
// but not the when field.
// It's OK to just drop an inactive timer and let the GC collect it.
// It's not OK to pass an inactive timer to addtimer.
// Only newly allocated timer values may be passed to addtimer.
//
// An active timer may be passed to modtimer.  No fields may be touched.
// It remains an active timer.
//
// An inactive timer may be passed to resettimer to turn into an
// active timer with an updated when field.
// It's OK to pass a newly allocated timer value to resettimer.
//
// Timer operations are addtimer, deltimer, modtimer, resettimer,
// cleantimers, adjusttimers, and runtimer.
