Go developers = Nazi book burners

When something goes against their corporate dictate the delete and ban.

What is the base for your deletions and bans?
Show us the rules which you follow, because there's nothing in the CoC about deleting legitimate issues.

If you believe that Go is a community project you're wrong.
Obivously it's owned by a faschist company named Alphabet and their lackeys cooperate with totalitarian regimes like China's pseudo-communist party to censor content and thoughts.

When issues and comments on issues are deleted because of corporate dictate that equals burning books by the Nazis of the 3rd Reich.

Arbitrariness, capriciousness, despotism - those seem to be the key values of Go's "corporate overlords".
